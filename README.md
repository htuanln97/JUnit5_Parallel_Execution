# JUnit5_Parallel_Execution
This is repository for demo JUnit5 Parallel Execution

### Why is parallel execution needed?
* Parallel testing is a process where multiple tests are executed simultaneously/in parallel in different thread processes.
* The main purpose of running tests in parallel mode is to reduce execution time and do maximum environment coverage (browsers/devices/environment) in less time.

### Junit 5 â€“ Parallel Execution
* By default, JUnit Jupiter tests are run sequentially in a single thread.
* This feature available as an opt-in feature since version 5.3.

### Setup
1.  Create simple maven project.
2.  Add these below dependencies to `pom.xml`.
    -   Go to maven dependency [JUnit Jupiter Engine](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-engine/).
    -   In this demo I also used playwright to run, so we will need this dependency as well [Playwright Main Library](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.playwright/playwright/).
3. Create a junit-platform.properties file in `src/test/resources`.
4. To enable parallel execution, set the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true`.
5. Configuration parameters to execute all tests in parallel:
    ```
    junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
    junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = concurrent

    ```
